## The Dataset

The data used for this tutorial is from [openfmri.org](https://openfmri.org/) and is structured according the new and fancy [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/).

The dataset ds005 used for this tutorial was shortened to only two subjects, *sub-15* and *sub-16* and restricted to the first two functional runs. For more information about the dataset, see the [description on openfmri.org](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000105/).
